Based around the work done by Quack Walks on their ROM set "Done Set"

**The Goal:** Create an automated tool to extract everything that Quack has curated to a Miyoo Mini SD card, most likely running [Onion OS](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion).


As Windows has the highest install base, a windows tool is the primary focus for initial development.

I am not a windows developer, I make no promises of quality.


## **How to use**
1. Download the "Auto Setup.bat" into the directory with all of the Done Set zip files.
